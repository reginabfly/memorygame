# Memory Game Project

This memory game was built utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This game is a simple application that resembles the typical memory game we all played as a child.

## How To Play The Game

To get started, just click any of the cards to make it turn over. Then proceed to find the match. If the two cards match, then the color will turn from blue to green. If they do not match, they will both flip over, the move counter will increase and you get to try again. The goal of the game is to find all 8 matches. There is a timer that keeps track of how long it took you to complete the game. 

Once all the matches are found, a modal will pop up alerting you of your win. It will include how many moves it took you to complete the game, your star rating and how long it took. You will then have the option to play again if you like. This game can be played on mobile devices, tablets and desktops. It is fully responsive using flexbox.
